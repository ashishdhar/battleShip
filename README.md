# battleShip
## Basic Gameplay
Turn based interactive game play on a configurable board size. The objective is for a player to sink his opponents ship. Grid of the board is represented by X,Y positions with both X and Y being integers. Ships occupy places on the grid. Each player gets a fixed number of turns plus bonus turns as long as he keeps scoring a hit.



## Assumptions
1. Player is choosing the type, number and size of his ships. He has to specify the top left position of his ship and its length and width. Type in "done" when he is finished placing his ships.
2. Fixed number of turns plus bonus turns as long as he keeps scoring hits.
3. Both X and Y axis is represented by integers. And not letters.
4. Game finishes when 1 player loses all his ships or the number of turns is completed.
